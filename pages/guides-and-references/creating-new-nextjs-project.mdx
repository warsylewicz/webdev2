# Guide: How to Create a New Next.js Project

### Part 1. Create a New Next.js Project

<Steps>

### Open a Terminal

Open a terminal on your computer. On Windows, you can open a terminal by pressing the Windows key and typing "cmd" and pressing Enter.

### Navigate to the Desired Directory

Change to the desired directory (folder) where you would like your project to be located. For example, if you want the projects in `c:\cprg306`, you would type the following commands:

```shell
c:
cd \
mkdir cprg306
cd cprg306
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  Do not use a cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox) for your
  project. This can cause problems with the `node_modules` folder because it
  contains thousands of files and will cause the cloud drive to sync constantly.
</Callout>

### Create the New Next.js Project

Enter the following command in the terminal to create a new Next.js project:

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

<Callout emoji="😣">
  If you receive an error like the following: `npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such
  file or directory, lstat 'C:\Users\[profile-name]\AppData\Roaming\npm'`, you
  may need to create a folder called `npm` in your Windows AppData\Roaming
  folder. You can do this by typing the following command in the terminal:
  `mkdir %AppData%\npm`
</Callout>

The create-next-app application will scaffold (create/generate) a new Next.js project. For the assignments, here is how you must answer the questions:

| Question                                              | Answer              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| What is your project named?                           | cprg306-assignments |
| Would you like to use TypeScript?                     | No                  |
| Would you like to use ESLint?                         | Yes                 |
| Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?                   | Yes                 |
| Would you like to use `src/` directory?               | No                  |
| Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)       | Yes                 |
| Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev?         | Yes                 |
| Would you like to customize the default import alias? | No                  |

Use the arrow keys to select the desired answer, then press Enter.

> Note: It is also possible to use the following non-interactive command to create a new Next.js project:
> `npx create-next-app@latest cprg306-assignments --js --eslint --tailwind --no-src-dir --app --turbopack --import-alias "@/*"`

### Close the Terminal

You can close the terminal now. From now on, you will only use the terminal in VS Code.

</Steps>

## Part 2: Running Your Next.js Application

<Steps>

### Open the New Project in VS Code

Open the project in VS Code using File -> Open Folder... and select the [app-name] folder that you have just created.

### Open the terminal in VS Code

You can open the terminal in VS Code by going to View -> Terminal or by pressing Ctrl-` (backtick - the key is usually located at the top left of the keyboard).

### Install Dependencies

In the terminal, run the following command to install the dependencies for the project:

```shell
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the Next.js development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Open the Application in Your Web Browser

After running npm run dev, a link to your local application (typically `http://localhost:3000`) will appear in the terminal. You can Ctrl-click this link to open it directly in your default web browser. If this doesn't work, you can manually open your preferred web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar. You should see your new Next.js application running!

### Stopping Development

When you are finished coding for the day and wish to shut down VS Code, you should shutdown the development server. In the terminal, press Ctrl-c to shut it down.

</Steps>

## Part 3: Push Your Project to GitHub Using GitHub Desktop

<Steps>

### Open GitHub Desktop

### Add Local Repository

Click on File -> Add local repository... and choose the folder for [app-name].

### Publish repository

Click the button "Push repository". It is recommended to keep the GitHub repository the same name as the app name.

**Uncheck "Keep this code private"** to allow the instructor access to your repository. Private repositories will be given a grade of 0.

Click the button "Publish repository".

### View the Repository Code

In a browser, navigate to `https://github.com/[GitHub-username]/[app-name]` to see the code in your browser.

</Steps>

## Part 4: Optional Files

While working on your project, you may want to consider adding a couple of optional files that can significantly impact how others view and use your work. The `LICENSE` file is crucial if you decide to open source your project; it tells others what they can and cannot do with your code. On the other hand, a well-crafted `README.md` serves as the front page of your project: it provides visitors with information about the project, how to install and use it, and how to contribute. Including these files can help build a community around your project and ensure that everyone understands the terms of use and collaboration.

### Adding a LICENSE File

To open-source your project, it's important to choose an appropriate license. A license dictates how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. Here's how to add a LICENSE file:

To add a LICENSE file to your Next.js project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:

1. **Open Your Project in VS Code:**

   - Launch VS Code.
   - Open your project by navigating to `File` > `Open Folder` and selecting your project's directory.

2. **Create the LICENSE File:**

   - Right-click on the explorer area in VS Code and select `New File`.
   - Name the file `LICENSE`.

3. **Choose a License:**

   - Go to [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).
   - Select a license that fits your project's needs. The MIT License is a popular choice for its permissiveness and simplicity. This website uses this license.

4. **Add the License Text:**

   - Copy the full license text from the website.
   - Paste the text into your new `LICENSE` file in VS Code.

5. **Save the LICENSE File:**

   - Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S` on Windows or `Cmd + S` on macOS.

6. **Commit and Push Your Changes with GitHub Desktop:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop and select your repository from the list.
   - You will see the `LICENSE` file listed as an uncommitted change.
   - Add a commit summary, such as "Add LICENSE file."
   - Click on `Commit to main` to commit the file to your main branch.
   - Click on `Push origin` to push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

### Editing the README.md File

The `README.md` file is the first thing people see when they visit your repository on GitHub. It should be informative and concise. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Project Title:**

   - Write a clear, descriptive title for your project.

2. **Description:**

   - Explain what your project does and why it's useful.
   - Include any key features or benefits.

3. **Installation Instructions:**

   - Provide a step-by-step guide to get your project running.

4. **Usage:**

   - Show how to use your project, with code examples or screenshots.

5. **Contributing:**

   - If you're open to contributions, explain how others can contribute.
   - Link to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file if you have one.

6. **Credits:**

   - Acknowledge any collaborators or sources of inspiration.

7. **License:**

   - Mention the type of license you've chosen.
   - You can add a section like this:

   ```markdown
   ## License

   This project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
   ```

If you have edited README.md, don't forget to save the file and then use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes.
