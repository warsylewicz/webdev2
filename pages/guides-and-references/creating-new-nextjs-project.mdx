# Guide: How to Create a New Next.js Project

### Part 1. Create a New Next.js Project

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Open Visual Studio Code

### Open the terminal in VS Code

You can open the terminal in VS Code by going to View -> Terminal or by pressing Ctrl-` (backtick - the key is usually located at the top left of the keyboard).

### Navigate to the Desired Directory

Change to the desired directory where you would like your project to be located. It's recommended to NOT use a cloud drive, e.g., do NOT use Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox. E.g., if you are creating your project on the Desktop, use:
`cd /Users/[windows account name]/Desktop`

Replace [windows account name] with your actual username.

### Create the New Next.js Project

Enter the following command:
`npx create-next-app@latest`

The create-next-app application will scaffold a new Next.js project. For the assignments, here is how you must answer the questions:

```
What is your project named? cprg306-assignments
Would you like to use TypeScript? No
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias? No
```

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout emoji="😣">
  If you receive an error like the following: `npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such
  file or directory, lstat 'C:\Users\[profile-name]\AppData\Roaming\npm'`, you
  may need to create a folder called npm in your AppData\Roaming folder. In
  Windows File Explorer, navigate to C:\Users\\[profile-name]\AppData\Roaming
  and create a new folder called `npm`.
</Callout>

### Open the New Project in VS Code

When create-next-app is finished, open the project in VS Code using File -> Open... and select the [app-name] folder that you have just created.

</Steps>

## Part 2: Running Your Next.js Application

<Steps>

### Start the Development Server

Navigate to the terminal in VS Code (which should still be open from the previous steps). Make sure you're in the project's root directory ([app-name]), then run the following command to start the Next.js development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Your application will start, and it will typically be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

### Open the Application in Your Web Browser

After running npm run dev, a link to your local application (typically `http://localhost:3000`) will appear in the terminal. You can Ctrl-click this link to open it directly in your default web browser. If this doesn't work, you can manually open your preferred web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar. You should see your new Next.js application running!

### Stopping Development

When you are finished coding for the day and wish to shut down VS Code, you should shutdown the development server. In the terminal, press Ctrl-c to shut it down.

</Steps>

## Part 3: Push Your Project to GitHub Using GitHub Desktop

<Steps>

### Open GitHub Desktop

### Add Local Repository

Click on File -> Add local repository... and choose the folder for [app-name].

### Publish repository

Click the button "Push repository". It is recommended to keep the GitHub repository the same name as the app name.

**Uncheck "Keep this code private"** to allow the instructor access to your repository. Private repositories will be given a grade of 0.

Click the button "Publish repository".

### View the Repository Code

In a browser, navigate to `https://github.com/[GitHub-username]/[app-name]` to see the code in your browser.

</Steps>
