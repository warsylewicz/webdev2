# Project Showcase

## Expectations

If you would like to showcase your project, please send me a message with the following information:

- Project title
- Project description
- GitHub repository link
- Deployed application link
- Any additional information you would like to share

I will add your project to the [Projects Showcase](/student-work/showcase) page for others to see. This is a great opportunity to share your hard work with your classmates and future students! This is optional, so feel free to participate only if you're interested.

## End of Web Dev 2 Course

Remember, the key to mastering web development is practice! Don't stop coding. Keep building, keep exploring, and keep pushing your limits.

This course material website will remain available for you to reference in the future. You may find it useful for your capstone project or for your future career. As you know, web development is a fast-paced field. As such, I will be updating the course material for future semesters, so you may want to check back in the future too!

Congratulations on reaching the end of our Web Dev 2 course! I hope you enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I wish you the best of luck in your next semester and beyond!
