# Week 4 Assignment

## Overview

For this week's assignment, you'll begin creating a `NewItem` component using React for a Shopping List App. You will finish creating this component in Week 5.

The NewItem component allows users to enter details about a new item they wish to add to a list which contains the following information:

- Item Name
- Quantity
- Category

For this week, we will focus just on the quantity.

## Prerequisites

If you did not complete Week 1 Assignment, complete the [Guide: Setting Up Your Development Environment](/guides-and-references/development-environment-setup) and send your GitHub username to the instructor.

If you did not complete the Week 2 Assignment, complete the [Guide: How to Create a New Next.js Project](/guides-and-references/creating-new-nextjs-project).

## Part 1: Link to Week 4 Assignment

Edit the project file `/app/page.js` and add a link to `week-4` in the list of links.

## Part 2:

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Create the Folder and Files

Create the folder `/app/week-4` and create files `page.js` and `new-item.js` inside it.

Edit `page.js` to be a Next.js page component that renders the NewItem component.

### Setup NewItem Component

- Add the `"use client"` directive to the top of the file.
- Import the useState hook from React.

### Initialize State Variables

**Quantity**

- Use the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `quantity` and a setter function called `setQuantity`.
- The initial value of `quantity` should be `1`, indicating that the quantity field is initially set to 1.

### Create `increment` and `decrement` Functions

- Create a function called `increment` that increments the `quantity` state variable by 1. Ensure that the quantity does not exceed 20.
- Create a function called `decrement` that decrements the `quantity` state variable by 1. Ensure that the quantity does not go below 1.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="️🙅">
  Don't forget to never modify the state directly. Always use the setter
  function provided by the `useState` hook, i.e. `setQuantity`.
</Callout>

### Render the Component

In the return statement of your function, render the following:

- The current quantity value.
- Decrement button
  - The button should call the `decrement` function when clicked.
  - The button should be disabled if the quantity is 1 to indicate to the user that the quantity cannot go below 1.
- Increment button
  - The button should call the `increment` function when clicked.
  - The button should be disabled if the quantity is 20 to indicate to the user that the quantity cannot exceed 20.

### Style the Component

Style the component using Tailwind CSS. You do not need to match the example output, but your component should be styled in a way that is visually appealing and easy to use.

### Test Your Component

Ensure that when the form is filled and submitted, an alert is displayed with the correct information and the form fields are reset.
