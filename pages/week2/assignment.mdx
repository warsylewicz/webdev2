# Week 2 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, you will create a new Next.js project and create a React component that displays your name, course section, and a link to your GitHub repository. You will also create a new page that displays the same information.

The Next.js project that you create here will be used for all of the assignments in this course. You will add new pages to the project for each assignment.

## Part 1: Create a New Next.js Project

Follow the [Guide: Creating a New Next.js Project](/guides-and-references/creating-new-nextjs-project) to create a new Next.js project. The project name and GitHub repository name must be `cprg306-assignments`.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Failure to name the project and repository correctly will result in a 0 for
  all assignments.
</Callout>

## Part 2: Application Requirements

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Create a React Component

Create a React component in the project `/app` folder called `StudentInfo` that returns the following static information:

- Your name
- Your course section, e.g. `CPRG 306 A`
- A link to your GitHub repository

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
You must use Link component from Next.js to link to your GitHub repository. Do not use the HTML anchor tag directly.

You may style the component if you wish, but it is not required. The component should be exported as the default export.

</Callout>

### Edit Root Page

For the root `/` route, which is the project file `/app/page.js`, edit the page to do the following:

- Display the heading: CPRG 306: Web Development 2 - Assignments
- Render `StudentInfo`
- Add a link to `/week2`

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
You must use `Link` component from Next.js to link to `/week2`. Do not use the HTML anchor tag directly.

You may style the page if you wish, but it is not required.

Example live view: [https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/)

</Callout>

### Create a New Page

Create a new page for `/week2` route, i.e. create a project file `/app/week2/page.js`. On this page:

- Display the heading: My Shopping List
- Render `StudentInfo`

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
You may style the page if you wish, but it is not required.

Example live view: [https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week2](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week2)

</Callout>

</Steps>

### Additional information

The [Guide: Coding Workflow](/guides-and-references/workflow) may help you with the coding workflow.

There is no requirement to deploy the application, but you may do so if you wish. See [Guide: Deploying a Next.js Application](/guides-and-references/deploying-nextjs-app) for instructions.

## Part 3: Assignment Submission

The instructor will be able to find your assignment in your GitHub repository. Make sure you have committed and pushed your changes to GitHub before the assignment deadline.

Ensure the following:

- You have completed the previous assignment and that the instructor has your GitHub username.
- The GitHub repository is **public** and named exactly `cprg306-assignments`.
- The new page is named exactly `week2` (lowercase).
