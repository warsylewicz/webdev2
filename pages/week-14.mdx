# Week 14: Complete Project

## Expectations

- Submit Phase 3 - [Reflection Form](https://forms.office.com/r/kT8RimSU4c) (Due end of week)

## Phase 2 - Sprint 3

Welcome to the third and final sprint of Phase 2! This is your opportunity to finalize your application, address any remaining issues, and ensure that all features are working as expected.

### Deployment

By the end of this sprint, you should have a fully functional, deployed version of your application. Remember, all changes should be pushed to your GitHub repository and automatically deployed to Vercel. This final deployment should represent a polished, user-ready version of your application.

### Sprint Goals

For this final sprint, you should aim to complete all remaining tasks and goals outlined in Phase 1. If there are any features or sections of your application that are incomplete, now is the time to finish them. Additionally, this is a good time to test your application thoroughly, fix any bugs, and make any necessary improvements to the user interface or user experience.

Remember, the goal of this final sprint is to complete your project and produce a fully functional, user-ready web application. Good luck, and happy coding!

## Project Phase 3: Self-reflection

As the final phase of your project, I want you to reflect on your project journey. This is an opportunity for you to evaluate how you managed the project, what you've learned, what went well, what didn't, and how you would approach a similar project differently in the future.

This self-reflection is not just an exercise in introspection but also a chance for you to assign your own grade for this project phase, which will account for 30% of the final grade of the course.

### Self-reflection Form

To complete this self-reflection, you will need to fill out the [Phase 3 - Self-reflection Form](https://forms.office.com/r/kT8RimSU4c). Everyone completes this form individually, even if you worked in a group for the project.
