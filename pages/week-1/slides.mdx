# Meet Each Other

Stand up, walk around. Talk to one person you know and one person you don't know. Ask each other:

1. What's your name?
2. Where are you from?
3. Why did you choose Software Development diploma at SAIT?
4. What do you want to be when you grow up (i.e. graduate)?

## Warning: THE COURSE CONTENT IS DIFFICULT

(I'm sorry)

Why? So many essential concepts and technologies and all are required to build a web application. Miss one and you're stuck.

E.g. command line interface, arrow functions, promises, objects, functions returning an array of functions, fetch API, React, Next.js, and much more

# Introduction to Web Application Development

## Web Dev 1: Websites

## Web Dev 2: Web Applications

The big difference: _interactivity_

---

## Typical Components of a Web Application

- Front-end
  - User interface
  - Client-side logic
- Back-end
  - Server-side logic
  - Database

---

## Typical Sequence of Events

1. User types a URL in the browser or clicks a link
2. The browser sends a (GET) request to the server
3. The server processes the request
4. The server sends a response (HTML) back to the browser
5. The browser renders the response and requests additional resources (CSS, JS, images)

---

## And then with _Interactivity_

6. The user interacts with the page (clicks a button, fills out a form)
7. The browser sends an asynchronous request to the server (POST, PUT, DELETE)
8. The server processes the request
9. The server sends a response back to the browser (JSON).
10. The browser updates the page with the new data
