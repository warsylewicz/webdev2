# Week 3 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll build a simple static shopping list. The focus is to understand and apply React props, a core concept in React programming, to pass data between components. You'll also practice using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Prerequisites

If you did not complete Week 1 Assignment, complete the [Guide: Setting Up Your Development Environment](/guides-and-references/development-environment-setup) and send your GitHub username to the instructor.

If you did not complete the Week 2 Assignment, complete the [Guide: How to Create a New Next.js Project](/guides-and-references/creating-new-nextjs-project).

## Part 1: Link to Week 3 Assignment

Edit the project file `/app/page.js` and add a link to `week3` in the list of links.

## Part 2: Build the Shopping List

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Create the Folder and Files

Create the folder `/app/week3` and create files `item.js`, `item-list.js`, and `page.js` inside it.

### Build the `Item` Component

In `item.js`, create a functional component named `Item`. This component should accept `name`, `quantity`, and `category` as props and display them in a list item element. Use Tailwind classes for styling.

### Build the `ItemList` Component

In `item-list.js`, create a functional component named `ItemList`. Inside this component, copy paste the following item objects each with `name`, `quantity`, and `category` properties. Render these items using the `Item` component you just created, passing item data as props.

```js copy
const item1 = {
  name: "milk, 4 L ü•õ",
  quantity: 1,
  category: "dairy",
};

const item2 = {
  name: "bread üçû",
  quantity: 2,
  category: "bakery",
};

const item3 = {
  name: "eggs, dozen ü•ö",
  quantity: 2,
  category: "dairy",
};

const item4 = {
  name: "bananas üçå",
  quantity: 6,
  category: "produce",
};

const item5 = {
  name: "broccoli ü•¶",
  quantity: 3,
  category: "produce",
};

const item6 = {
  name: "chicken breasts, 1 kg üçó",
  quantity: 1,
  category: "meat",
};

const item7 = {
  name: "pasta sauce üçù",
  quantity: 3,
  category: "canned goods",
};

const item8 = {
  name: "spaghetti, 454 g üçù",
  quantity: 2,
  category: "dry goods",
};

const item9 = {
  name: "toilet paper, 12 pack üßª",
  quantity: 1,
  category: "household",
};

const item10 = {
  name: "paper towels, 6 pack",
  quantity: 1,
  category: "household",
};

const item11 = {
  name: "dish soap üçΩÔ∏è",
  quantity: 1,
  category: "household",
};

const item12 = {
  name: "hand soap üßº",
  quantity: 4,
  category: "household",
};
```

### Build the `Page` Component

In `page.js`, create a functional component named `Page` that returns a `main` element wrapped around the `ItemList` component. Use Tailwind classes for styling.

### Run and Test Your App

Run your app and test it in the browser. You should see a list of items. Debug any errors you encounter.

### Example Output

https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week3

### Application Requirements

- Use appropriate semantic HTML elements, e.g. `li` for list items.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling. You are free to use any Tailwind classes you want and you do not need to match the [Example Output](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/week3). However, your app should look good and be easy to use. Choose a colour scheme that is easy on the eyes. I recommend choosing two colours and using shades of those colours for your app.

## Part 3: Assignment Submission

The instructor will be able to find your assignment in your GitHub repository. Make sure you have committed and pushed your changes to GitHub before the assignment deadline.

Ensure the following:

- The instructor has your current GitHub username.
- The GitHub repository is **public** and named exactly `cprg306-assignments`.
- The new page is named exactly `week3` (lowercase).
